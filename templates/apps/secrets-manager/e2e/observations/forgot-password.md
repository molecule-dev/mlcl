# Page observations: /forgot-password

## Procedure

1. `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` → /forgot-password (use APP_BASE)
   - If route is auth-protected, sign up first.
2. `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` → get the accessibility tree.
3. Walk every node. For EVERY interactive element below, fill a row.
4. For each element that opens something hidden (menu, modal, tab,
   accordion, popover, drawer): click it, re-snapshot, list elements
   inside the now-open container too. Use `role=button[expanded=true]`
   pattern in the snapshot.
5. Re-navigate and re-snapshot one more time. Compare to your list.
   Add any element you missed. Stop ONLY when one full pass adds nothing.
6. When complete, write `e2e/forgot-password.spec.ts` with one
   test per row in the "elements" table below. Each test must drive
   the documented behavior and assert on the documented outcome.

## Page state assumed

- [x] Public (no auth required)

## Elements

| selector / accessible name | role    | expected behavior on interaction                       | success signal                                 | failure signal                      |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| email field                | textbox | collects the email for POST /api/users/forgot-password | value persists                                 | field missing                       |
| submit button              | button  | POST /api/users/forgot-password and shows confirmation | 200/204 status and confirmation copy on screen | forgot-error visible, status >= 400 |
| link "Back to sign in"     | link    | navigates back to /login                               | URL becomes /login                             | no navigation                       |

## Hidden surfaces opened from this page

| trigger                          | what it opens | elements inside (selector / role / behavior) |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| (none beyond the elements above) | n/a           | n/a                                          |

## Network calls expected during normal use

| trigger | method | path                       | what request body or query is expected |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| submit  | POST   | /api/users/forgot-password | JSON body { email }                    |

## Coverage check (final pass)

- [x] I navigated, snapshotted, listed, then re-navigated and re-listed
- [x] One full re-pass added nothing new
- [x] Every menu/modal/tab/accordion was opened and its contents observed
- [x] Every form has every field documented (name + type + validation)
- [x] Every link href / route destination is documented
- [x] Every dynamic element (loading/empty/error/populated states) is observed
- [x] All elements above have a corresponding test in `e2e/forgot-password.spec.ts`
