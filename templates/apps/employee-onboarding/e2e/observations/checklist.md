## Coverage check (final pass)

- [x] I navigated, snapshotted, listed, then re-navigated and re-listed
- [x] One full re-pass added nothing new
- [x] Every menu/modal/tab/accordion was opened and its contents observed
- [x] Every form has every field documented (name + type + validation)
- [x] Every link href / route destination is documented
- [x] Every dynamic element (loading/empty/error/populated states) is observed
- [x] All elements above have a corresponding test in the matching e2e/<page>.spec.ts
