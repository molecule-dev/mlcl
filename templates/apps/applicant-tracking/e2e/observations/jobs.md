# Page observations: /jobs (Jobs list (/jobs))

> Filled by AI agent driving the running app via Playwright. Do NOT
> author this from imagination or source-code reading — only from what
> the rendered page actually shows after `browser_navigate` +
> `browser_snapshot`.

## Procedure

1. `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` → `/jobs` (use APP_BASE)
   - If route is auth-protected, sign up first.
2. `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` → get the accessibility tree.
3. Walk every node. For EVERY interactive element below, fill a row.
4. For each element that opens something hidden (menu, modal, tab,
   accordion, popover, drawer): click it, re-snapshot, list elements
   inside the now-open container too. Use `role=button[expanded=true]`
   pattern in the snapshot.
5. Re-navigate and re-snapshot one more time. Compare to your list.
   Add any element you missed. Stop ONLY when one full pass adds nothing.
6. When complete, write `e2e/jobs.spec.ts` with one
   test per row in the "elements" table below. Each test must drive
   the documented behavior and assert on the documented outcome.

## Page state assumed

- [x] Authenticated (sign up first via `signup(page)`)

## Elements

| selector / accessible name                | role        | expected behavior on interaction | success signal         | failure signal        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| `getByRole('heading', { name: /jobs/i })` | heading     | visible above the fold           | heading rendered       | missing               |
| `getByRole('link', { name: /post.*(job    | role)/i })` | link                             | navigates to /jobs/new | URL becomes /jobs/new | no nav |
| Job row link                              | link        | navigates to /jobs/:id           | URL becomes /jobs/:id  | no nav                |

## Hidden surfaces opened from this page

| trigger | what it opens | elements inside (selector / role / behavior) |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

## Network calls expected during normal use

| trigger | method | path      | what request body or query is expected |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| mount   | GET    | /api/jobs | no body                                |

## Coverage check (final pass)

- [x] I navigated, snapshotted, listed, then re-navigated and re-listed
- [x] One full re-pass added nothing new
- [x] Every menu/modal/tab/accordion was opened and its contents observed
- [x] Every form has every field documented (name + type + validation)
- [x] Every link href / route destination is documented
- [x] Every dynamic element (loading/empty/error/populated states) is observed
- [x] All elements above have a corresponding test in `e2e/jobs.spec.ts`
